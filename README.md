# Pytorch_Autoencoder_Example
Autoencoder which acts same as traditional 3 bit encoder

## 0. Experiment Motivation

Following is a network representation.

## 1. Prepare Data
Data are already saved as 'data.pickle'. The file comprises 8 kinds of one-hot encoded 8 bit data, number of data is 1000 for each kind. 
(details are below)


[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] x 1000
[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] x 1000
.
.
.
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] x 1000

The file is generated by "generate_one_hot_data.py".

## 2. Train

## 3. Test
Test results are as follows.
